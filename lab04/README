Any .txt file can be passed into the program. The format of the text file should be
as follows:
	- 9x9 grid of numbers
	- empty spaces are marked with a 0
	- no spaces between numbers
Included are three sample .txt files, for convenience: test1, test2, & test3

***As a note, when running the command ./sudoku human_input.txt, a segfault will occur.
This is just because my quit program logic is just the innate Ctrl+C, so the ^C command
is being executed too early when the commands are redirected to the textfile. The seg
fault will not occur in a normal human-input game.

Enjoy
